# Manual Deployment Guide for Surveasy

## Issue: Netlify Build Failing with Exit Code 2

Since the automated Netlify build is failing, here are alternative deployment methods:

---

## Option 1: Manual Build + Drag & Drop

### Step 1: Build Locally
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd "C:\Users\INDIITibo\Documents\augment-projects\Surveasy"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls dist/
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag the entire `dist` folder to the deployment area
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Get your live URL

---

## Option 2: Try Alternative Configurations

### Minimal Configuration
Replace `netlify.toml` with minimal version:
```bash
cp netlify-minimal.toml netlify.toml
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Try minimal Netlify configuration"
git push
```

### Verbose Configuration (for debugging)
```bash
cp netlify-verbose.toml netlify.toml
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Try verbose Netlify configuration for debugging"
git push
```

---

## Option 3: Use Different Build Commands

### Try in Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy
2. Try these build commands one by one:

**Option A: Simple**
```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
```

**Option B: With Install**
```
Build command: npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: dist
```

**Option C: Clean Install**
```
Build command: rm -rf node_modules && npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: dist
```

---

## Option 4: Alternative Platforms

If Netlify continues to fail, try these alternatives:

### Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import from GitHub
3. Framework preset: Vite
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`

### GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Use GitHub Actions for deployment
3. Automatic build and deploy on push

### Surge.sh
```bash
# Install Surge
npm install -g surge

# Build and deploy
npm run build
cd dist
surge
```

---

## Option 5: Troubleshooting Steps

### Check Build Logs
1. In Netlify Dashboard → Deploys
2. Click on failed deploy
3. Expand "Deploy log"
4. Look for specific error messages after line 323

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Memory Issues**
- Add to netlify.toml: `NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"`

**Dependency Issues**
- Try: `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`

**Build Tool Issues**
- Use: `npx vite build` instead of `npm run build`
